          22222222222222222222 The curtain fell on the first-ever fully virtual
          edition of Web Summit in the final stretch of a year that will be
          remembered in history as one of massive global disruption, with almost
          all live events from around the world either postponed or canceled as
          part of a bid to stem the tide of the novel coronavirus. But the end
          of Europe’s biggest technology conference marked the beginning of a
          new chapter of raised hopes for the return of large-scale on-site
          gatherings, which might feel like a thing of the past now amid
          quarantine and lockdowns.

          3333333333333333333333 “The venue is booked,” Web Summit’s CEO and
          co-founder Paddy Cosgrave told Reuters in a recent interview about the
          2021 edition of the tech meeting. “I think by November Web Summit will
          be happening in-person, and I can’t wait.” The event, which moved from
          Dublin to Lisbon in 2016, hosts around 70,000 participants every year
          and features an impressive line-up of politicians, celebrities, and
          keynote speakers from top global technology companies. This year’s
          sessions were hosted on the conference’s own online platform in the
          first week of December, offering tech enthusiasts a much-needed
          opportunity to end this surreal year off on a high note.

          4444444444444444444444The organizers are already encouraging Web
          Summit fans to save 50% on their ticket by pre-registering for a 2 for
          1 discount code. “You’ll get two Web Summit tickets for the price of
          one, so you can bring a friend for free,” reads an upbeat announcement
          on a page dedicated to the 2021 event, which is scheduled to run from
          November 1 to 4. The expected return of the conference in physical
          format was not the only news coming out of the organizers of Web
          Summit, which, in the words of Forbes, is “the best tech conference on
          the planet” and is described by Politico as “the Olympics of tech”.

          55555555555555555555 Announcing a series of expansion deals and plans,
          Cosgrave said recently that his Dublin-based company has signed a
          five-year deal with Japanese officials to host a new event in Tokyo
          from September 2022. He was quoted as saying by the Irish Independent
          that the on-site conference will be called Web Summit Tokyo. The Irish
          entrepreneur also announced that a Web Summit conference will be held
          in Brazil in 2022 in either Rio de Janeiro or Porto Alegre.

          666666666666666666666 Separately, Cosgrave said plans are underway to
          revive RISE, one of Asia’s largest tech gatherings, in March 2022. The
          event, which is produced by the team behind Web Summit, will move to
          Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia after five years in Hong Kong, following a
          three-year deal with the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation to host
          offline conferences. Though there is not much to celebrate in the
          lead-up to the new year, we should not let it drift into oblivion that
          the world has risen from the ashes on many occasions in the past and
          history can repeat itself.

          777777777777777777777 “With Super Bowl parties either scaled way down
          or just canceled, it probably makes sense to sit this one out at this
          cost” for certain marketing categories, Brian Sheehan, a professor of
          advertising at Syracuse University’s SI Newhouse School of Public
          Communications, told Variety. A 30-second spot in Super Bowl LV costs
          advertisers $5.5 million, and brands are rightly concerned about the
          optics of spending that much when the country is facing the ongoing
          coronavirus pandemic and racial, political and social unrest. CBS,
          which will air the showdown between the Kansas City Chiefs and Tampa
          Bay Buccaneers on Sunday, February 7, had sold about 80% of its ad
          slots in early December, according to AdAge. By contrast, Fox sold out
          of ad spots before Thanksgiving when it aired the game in 2020.
